# My Project Plan (Level 1 Heading)

***Note***: This document is written merely as an illustrative example, and does not provide any working guide to an actual project.

### Proposal (Level 3 Heading)
---
I am planning to make a computer vision software that detects objects in images.
In order to build it, I will use opencv, deep learning libraries, such as [TensoftFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/?hl=ko) or [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/), and other open source softwares.

For example, the object in the follwing images were detected using [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection):
